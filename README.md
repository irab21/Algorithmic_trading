Both algorithmic and manual trading focus on capitalizing on market inefficiencies. Algorithmic trading involves using automated computer models to analyse market data and execute trades. It is ideal for addressing persistent inefficiencies, where trading opportunities occur repeatedly in a similar pattern.
For example, if gold prices are consistently lower on a Japanese exchange compared to a US exchange (after factoring in the USDJPY currency rate), one can continuously buy on the cheaper exchange and sell on the higher-priced one whenever the price gap appears.
Manual trading is more suited for capturing one-off inefficiencies. An example of this is hedge fund manager John Paulson, who personally profited $3.7 billion by betting against the US housing market in 2007, an exceptional, one-time event.
This study investigates the efficacy of various statistical and machine learning models in algorithmic trading, focusing on AAPL stock across two distinct periods: 2010–2018 and 2018–2024. The primary goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of statistical models like the Simple Moving Average (SMA) strategy, Random Walk Hypothesis (RWH), and frequency-based strategies with machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (Gaussian NB), Logistic Regression, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis.
The adoption of big data analytics in finance has provided unprecedented opportunities to uncover complex relationships between market variables that traditional methods often overlook. By incorporating machine learning and advanced statistical techniques, this research seeks to highlight innovative trading strategies and their implications for modern financial markets.
